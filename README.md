# Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow

This is a project on learning how to preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification, building TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and training and evaluating a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub. Previous experience with the Python programming language, be familiar with deep learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP), and have trained models with TensorFlow or and its Keras API will benefit better understanding of this project.

_Objectives:_
1. Load the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset
2. Create tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation
3. Download a Pre-trained BERT Model from TensorFlow Hub
4. Tokenize and Preprocess Text for BERT
5. Wrap a Python Function into a TensorFlow op for Eager Execution
6. Create a TensorFlow Input Pipeline with tf.data
7. Add a Classification Head to the BERT hub.KerasLayer
8. Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification
9. Evaluate the BERT Text Classification Model

This implementation is a part of the course "Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow" Course from Coursera.
